                    <br><br>We provide an invaluable opportunity for students to make informed decisions about their educational journey. 
                    Our unique ML-tool allows students to explore and compare various educational programs offered by different universities. 
                    By considering their interests, skills, and hobbies, students can choose the university that aligns best with their aspirations.

                    <br><br>Universities 
                    <br><br>We empower universities to enhance their educational programs and services. Our platform enables universities to compare their offerings with those of other institutions, facilitating the identification of areas for development.
